# WPF Data Grid - Bind to Server Mode with XPO

This example shows the WPF Data Grid bound to the [XPServerCollectionSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.XPServerCollectionSource). You should restore the **NorthwindXpo** database from the backup file on your SQL Server prior to running the sample. When the Data Grid works in [Server Mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/6279/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/bind-to-data/server-mode-and-instant-feedback), data operations (filter, sort, group) are performed at the database server level. SQL queries generated by [XPO](http://www.devexpress.com/xpo) are displayed in a text box under the Data Grid.

## Files to Look At

* [NorthwindXpo.cs](./CS/XpoNorthwindServerMode/NorthwindXpo.cs) (VB: [NorthwindXpo.vb](./VB/XpoNorthwindServerMode/NorthwindXpo.vb))
* [Window1.xaml](./CS/XpoNorthwindServerMode/Window1.xaml) (VB: [Window1.xaml](./VB/XpoNorthwindServerMode/Window1.xaml))
* [Window1.xaml.cs](./CS/XpoNorthwindServerMode/Window1.xaml.cs) (VB: [Window1.xaml.vb](./VB/XpoNorthwindServerMode/Window1.xaml.vb))

## More Examples

The following example shows how to bind the WPF Data Grid to different data sources: [Bind the WPF Data Grid to Data](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-bind-wpf-grid-to-data).

This example includes multiple solutions that demonstrate:
* How to bind the Data Grid to Entity Framework, EF Core, and XPO.
* Different binding mechanisms: virtual sources, server mode sources, and local data.
* MVVM and code-behind patterns.

After you bind the Data Grid to a database, you can implement CRUD operations (create, read update, delete). View the example: [Implement CRUD Operations in the WPF Data Grid](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-implement-crud-operations).
